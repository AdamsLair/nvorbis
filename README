NVorbis
-------

NVorbis is a .Net library for decoding Xiph.org Vorbis files.  It is purely
managed code, and should run correctly in partial-trust environments.

This implementation is based on the Vorbis specification found on xiph.org.
Portions were "borrowed" from elsewhere.  Specifically, the Huffman code
generator and the MDCT algorithm were adapted from csvorbis.  Also,
libvorbis was referenced heavily during development.

Currently the only container supported is Xiph.org Ogg.  Matroska and RTP
are planned.

To use:

- Create an instance of NVorbis.VorbisReader (pass the Ogg Vorbis filename in)
- Use these properties to gather data about the logical stream:
	- Channels
	- SampleRate
	- TotalTime		- A TimeSpan indicating the total length of the audio data
	- DecodedTime	- A TimeSpan indicating the last returned sample's timestamp
	- NominalBitrate, UpperBitrate, and LowerBitrate
		- These are the encoder's reported bitrates
	- Vendor	- The encoder's vendor string
	- Comments	- An array of comments in the file (usually tags)
- Call "int ReadSamples(float[], int, int)" to retrieve the next batch of
  samples.  It will return 0 when the logical Vorbis stream is done.
