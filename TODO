* Check that Floor0 is implemented correctly
* Check that Residue0 is implemented correctly
* Check that seeking is implemented correctly

* RTP support
	- Put an interface between VorbisReader and OggContainerReader
	- Implement the same interface for RTP (non-seekable)
	- Add a constructor for VorbisReader that accepts a NetworkStream
		- Possibly another System.Net member?  Needs thought.

* Matroska support
	- Needs a base EBML reader

* More optimization?  Currently running at 113x realtime on a Core i7 M 620
	- look for places where we can move logic into header decode
	- more profiling

* Test with a lot more Vorbis streams

* Test / Add support for Mono & Unix (including makefile!)
