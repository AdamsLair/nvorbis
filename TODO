* Check that Floor0 is implemented correctly
* Check that Residue0 is implemented correctly

* Put an interface between the decoder and the container reader (needed for RTP / Matroska / Ogg Skeleton)

* MAYBE: Re-write the Ogg container reader to make use of more intelligent buffering

* RTP support
	- Put an interface between VorbisReader and OggContainerReader
	- Implement the same interface for RTP (non-seekable)
	- Add a constructor for VorbisReader that accepts a NetworkStream
		- Possibly another System.Net member?  Needs thought.

* Matroska support
	- Needs a base EBML reader

* More optimization?  Currently running at > 94x realtime on a Core i7 M 620
	- look for places where we can move logic into header decode
	- more profiling

* Test with a lot more Vorbis streams
